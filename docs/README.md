# markdown-publisher-toolkit

So here‚Äôs what happened: I got asked to share some of my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/anchildress1) posts on another site, [Coder Legion](https://coderlegion.com/user/anchildress1). Cool, easy yes. Except‚Ä¶ the very first time I tried to publish, I hit the wall of oh, they actually want HTML, not just Markdown. And listen, I‚Äôve spent years letting Markdown do all the heavy lifting while I sip coffee and type a couple of hashes and dashes. Manually fiddling with HTML? That‚Äôs where joy goes to die.

Which means, of course, I immediately spun up Yet Another Test App‚Ñ¢. This one‚Äôs supposed to do double duty: my first real attempt at bundling an NPM package (maybe even tossing it up on GitHub proper), and a not-ChatGPT-spit-out-and-left-static UI. I want it shiny: animations, styling, whole new palette, fresh logo, the works.

> ü¶Ñ Luckily I stumbled onto [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) before I got too deep.

Also, I‚Äôm sneaking in some beta testing for a new AI solution I‚Äôve been poking at‚Äîso this doubles as hack-time fuel for those experiments. I‚Äôll share more when the NDAs and timing gods allow, but for now: check back soon. Once I get this posted, deployed, and actually connected to that dusty domain I keep promising myself I‚Äôll set up, all the fun bits will start rolling.
