## License 📄

Every project has to have a stack of fine print somewhere. _Keep going, keep going, keep going..._ Here's mine, as painless as possible:

You know where [the license](./LICENSE) is, but I'll sum it up: **this is not open source** (even though you can still do just about anything you want with it). Do what you want—as long as you're not turning it into the next big SaaS or selling subscriptions in the cloud. For that, **you've gotta ask me first.**

Basically? This project's got boundaries. Be cool, don't try to sneak it into a product launch, and we'll get along just fine. 😘

## Acknowledgments 🙏

- **Coder Legion**: For the inspiration—and for letting me ask a million questions.
  - Seriously, Andrew had _no idea_ what he was signing up for, but deserves a medal for surviving the process. 🏅
- **Dev Community**: For providing an excellent API, an even better platform, and the kind of dev crowd that makes all of this even remotely possible.
  - Without y'all, this project probably wouldn't exist in the first place.

### The ones who had no idea they helped

...but this would've been impossible without them

- **Unified Ecosystem**: For all the markdown magic under the hood. Seriously, your tools just work.
- **Verdent Team**: For building the kind of platform that makes "just one more experiment" dangerously easy.
